Main File: Flowshop.java
 
Input: All the input files can be found on the input folder.

Output: the final result will be recorded into the "output-IG.txt" file after execution the program. 
The execution time takes around 95 -120 min depending on the system configuration.
Also due to the fact that some parts of the algorithm take random decisions, 
every execution of the program may produce results with very small differences with the previous result in the output file. 

Dependencies: We did not include any extra packages, as we didn't find it necessary.

The program can be compiled and run with JAVA compiler.
